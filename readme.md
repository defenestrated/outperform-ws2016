## a repository for shared resources -- code, readings, etc. ##

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you've never seen it before, this is GitHub, which is a place to store, share, and keep track of code as it updates and changes.

We don't really have time to get into it in class, but if anyone's interested there's a decent explanation here:

Arduino examples are in the "examples" folder, any readings we hand out are in "readings"
(fairly self-explanatory, i suppose)

You can click into the folders and copy/paste the code directly, or download the whole thing as a zip file.
